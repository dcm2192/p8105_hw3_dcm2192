This code contains my answers to P8105 HW 3. 

## Problem 1

Load NY NOAA dataset.
```{r}
data("ny_noaa")
```

The `ny_noaa` dataset is comprised of `r nrow(ny_noaa)` observations of `r ncol(ny_noaa)` variables. Its variables include `id`, which is the weather station ID; `date`, which is the date of observation; `prcp`, the amount of precipitation measured in mm; `snow`, the amount of snowfall measured in mm; `snwd`, the snow depth measured in mm; `tmax` and `tmin`, the maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius. A significant portion of the `ny_noaa` dataset contains missing data (values of 0 or `NA`) for its measurements of precipitation, snowfall and depth, and temperature.
