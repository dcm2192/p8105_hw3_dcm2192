This code contains my answers to P8105 HW 3.

## Problem 1

Load NY NOAA dataset.

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

The `ny_noaa` dataset is comprised of 2595176 observations of 7
variables. Its variables include `id`, which is the weather station ID;
`date`, which is the date of observation; `prcp`, the amount of
precipitation measured in mm; `snow`, the amount of snowfall measured in
mm; `snwd`, the snow depth measured in mm; `tmax` and `tmin`, the
maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius. A significant
portion of the `ny_noaa` dataset contains missing data (values of 0 or
`NA`) for its measurements of precipitation, snowfall and depth, and
temperature.
