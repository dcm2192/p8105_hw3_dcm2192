This code contains my answers to P8105 HW 3.

## Problem 1

*Load NY NOAA dataset.*

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

The `ny_noaa` dataset is comprised of 2595176 observations of 7
variables. Its variables include `id`, which is the weather station ID;
`date`, which is the date of observation; `prcp`, the amount of
precipitation measured in mm; `snow`, the amount of snowfall measured in
mm; `snwd`, the snow depth measured in mm; `tmax` and `tmin`, the
maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius. A significant
portion of the `ny_noaa` dataset contains missing data (values of 0 or
`NA`) for its measurements of precipitation, snowfall and depth, and
temperature.

*Clean NY NOAA dataset.*

Create separate columns for year, month, day. Adjust variables to
appropriate data types.

``` r
ny_noaa <- 
  ny_noaa |>  
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax),
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin))
```

Find most commmon values for snowfall.

``` r
ny_noaa |> 
  count(snow) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 282 × 2
    ##     snow       n
    ##    <int>   <int>
    ##  1     0 2008508
    ##  2    NA  381221
    ##  3    25   31022
    ##  4    13   23095
    ##  5    51   18274
    ##  6    76   10173
    ##  7     8    9962
    ##  8     5    9748
    ##  9    38    9197
    ## 10     3    8790
    ## # ℹ 272 more rows

The most commonly observed values for snowfall are 0, followed by `NA`.
This is because many of these observations are missing data for
snowfall, either because none was recorded on that day or because the
data was otherwise missing (possibly due to failure to take
measurements). Following these, the next most common values are 25mm,
13mm, and 51mm.
